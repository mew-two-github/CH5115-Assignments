## CH5115 Assignments
My solutions for the assignments and quizzes in the course Parameter and State Estimation, Fall 2020. Contents of the assignments:
1. Statistics review: (conditional) expectations, variances, MAE prediction using Monte Carlo simulations
2. Random signals, stationarity, Fisher Information:
  i.   Check for stationarity: numerically and theoritically
  ii.  Check for signal properties given process evolution model. Verify numerically (for given Signal to Noise ratio)
  iii. Building an **ARIMA model** for a given data
  iv.  Fisher Information and Maximum Likelihood Estimator
3. Power Spectral Decomposition & Fourier transform, MVUE, BLUE, CRLB, Hypothesis Testing, Efficiency of estimator using Monte Carlo simulations
4. Distribution fitting, Maximum Likelihood estimator, Step-wise linear regression, RIDGE & LASSO (theoritical aspects), Bayesian Estimation using Jeffrey's Prior
5. Recursive Least Squares, Pole Placement Observer, Kalman filter (for linear dynamical system: MATLAB, non linear: SIMULINK)
